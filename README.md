**_Glǽmscribe_** would never have been possible without the unworthy and inconditionnal help and wisdom of **_Bertrand Bellet_**.

Glǽmscribe would never have come to be without the ceaseless and continuously renewed work of the great family of Internet Tolkienists, both on technologies (with several generations of transcribers and typefaces) and on knowledge shared and gathered on websites and forums. Neither would it exist without the devoted labour of all those that make the publication of Tolkien's linguistic works possible. A very big thank you to them all!
