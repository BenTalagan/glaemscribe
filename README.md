# Glǽmscribe

[**_Glǽmscribe_**](https://jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/glaemscribe.html) (also written **_Glaemscribe_**) is a software dedicated to
the transcription of texts between writing systems, and more specifically dedicated to the transcription of J.R.R. Tolkien's invented languages to some of his devised writing systems (Tengwar, Sarati, Cirth, ...).

The current version is 1.2.0 (August 2019).

Official integration
--------------------

Here is [**_the official integration of Glǽmscribe's engine_**](https://jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/glaemscribe.html).

Features
--------

* Handles a large variety of writings (Tengwar, Cirth, Sarati, Runes and more).
* Offers modes for a large variety of fictional languages (Quenya, Sindarin, Khuzdul, Black Speech, Adûnaic, Telerin, Noldorin, Valarin, Westron) and non-fictional languages (Old English, Old Norse, Japanese).
* Extensible through a custom programmation language dedicated to the writing of modes.
* Allow modes to be designed and programmed to have conditional behaviours depending on independant, custom options.
* Separates the handling of modes and charsets, making the mode files purely 'logical' and compliant with all fonts, and pushing back font issues to charset files.
* Compliant with opentype and non-opentype fonts, so that we can handle old-gen (Parmaite, Eldamar, Annatar...) fonts as well as new-gen ones (FreeMono, Telcontar, Eldamar Sarati - glaemscribe version with opentype features, ...), so that have a smooth transition between technologies.
* Offers a mechanism to compensate diacritic and ligature issues for non-opentype fonts through 'virtual characters', allowing mode files to be generic and far more simple to write.
* Has support for inlined, spelled tengwar (or any other writing, respectively) for complete control on the output.
* Has an official graphical, friendly integration (see above).
* Has a graphical IDE for helping users to write mode files.
* Exists as a javascript library or a ruby library.
* Has a command-line tool implementation (in ruby).

* Rewrite the charset editor which is now obsolete since the introduction of virtual chars (will probably be dropped : to much hassle for something which can be done easily and once with a text editor).
