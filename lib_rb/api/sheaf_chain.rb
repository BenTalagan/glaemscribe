# A sheaf chain is a sequence of sheaves. e.g. :
#
# With a global rule of : src => res
# Where src = "[a,b,c][d,e,f]"
# and   res = "[x,y,z][1,2,3]"
#
# The generated rules is a list of 9 parallel rules: 
# ad => x1, ae => x2, af => res => x3
# bd => y1, be => y2, etc...
#
# Or, more complicated: "[m,(b|p)](h|y)[a,e]"
# Will generate the following equivalences:
# mha = mya
# mhe = mye
# bha = pha = bya = pya
# bhe = phe = bye = phe
