This tool helps building virtual chars by dumping interactive html comparison charts for tengwar.

The user choses the variants he/she'd like to use, and can dump the result to save it in his/her charset file.

It is in pretty early stage of conception and will probably stay in its state (it does the job it needs to do).

Usage
=====

No configuration, just edit the script by hand. 
Launch. It will pick the charsets in ../glaemsresources/charsets/.
Open the generated HTML charts (generated from the charsets).
Chose your variants, then dump button.
Re-incorporate the result into charset files.
