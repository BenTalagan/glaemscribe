This tool helps building virtual chars by building comparison chars for tengwar.

The user choses the variants he'd like to use, and can dump the result to save it in his charset file.

It is in pretty early stage of conception and will probably stay in its state (it does the job it need too).

Usage
=====

No configuration, just edit the script by hand. 
Launch. 
Use the generated HTML charts (generated from the charsets).<
Chose your variants, then dump button.
